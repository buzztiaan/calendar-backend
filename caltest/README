This is a caltest tests directory for calendar-backend

Steps:

Run command 

make check

to compile the surces and generate the binary "Caltest"

On compilation it also generates the files *.gcno that
measure the code coverage metrics.

Run Caltest on terminal x86 environment

After this we have CalTest.xml file which has the results
and additional *.gcda files are generated(for code coverage).

Now run the command (in caltest dir)

xmlto --skip-validation -x report.xsl html Caltest.xml

Now run the command (outside scratchbox)

lcov --directory . -c -o caltest.info

Need to install lcov utility for the same (Can do it outside scratchbox)
and run the command outside scratchbox giving the path for the calendar-backend
directory.

e.g

lcov --directory /scratchbox/users/$USER/home/$USER/somedir/calendar-backend/

It looks for the gcda files recursively and generates the caltest.info file.

Now run the command

 genhtml -o coverage caltest.info

It will generate the html files in the directory coverage.
